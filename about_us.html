              <a href="https://www.seventhgeneration.com" target="_blank">Seventh Generation</a> is a sustainable home cleaning product company, based in Burlington, Vermont.
              For the past 30 years, Seventh Generation has been committed to using business as a force for good.
              The company partners with like-minded organizations, like CREATE Lab, to advocate for the rights of people and the planet because they believe that a company's values are as important as the products it makes.
              Seventh Generation knows that plant-based products can provide the efficacy you are looking for, and that products designed from renewable plant-based ingredients are a more sustainable option than ingredients made from petroleum.
              Above all, they believe that we have a responsibility to this generation and the next seven, and invite us all on their journey to nurture the health of the next seven generations.

              In 2018, Seventh Generation partnered with the <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/ready-for-100" target="_blank">Sierra Club's Ready for 100 campaign</a> asking cities across the country to commit to 100% renewable energy.
              This effort is in service of a healthier future for all -- a move to 100% renewable energy will help reduce negative health effects (like asthma) caused by burning fossil fuels.
              Join the movement for 100% clean energy.
              Over 100 cities have committed to running on clean energy by 2035 -- is your city #Readyfor100?

              REACT is fighting for legislation against toxic air pollution from chemical facilities, the protection of residents in the event of a leak or explosion in a chemical facility or rail car, and full disclosure and easy access to information concerning the impact of Rubbertown on the community.
